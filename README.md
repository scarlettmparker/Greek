### What to avoid as a beginner
Though there are many resources out there that provide accurate and useful information for Greek, there are also a lot that contain a lot of misinformation and will provide very little help, or may even hinder your progress with Modern Greek. Here are some sites/apps you should avoid.

The below comes from experience. As an upper-intermediate Greek learner who has had to sift through this stuff, these recommendations are in place to ensure you don't make the same mistakes that I did. If you wish to still do all of this, anyway, feel free to do so. I don't wish to force any specific method of learning on anyone, and this is just general advice.
#### Duolingo
If you're a complete beginner looking to learn the basics, *do not use Duolingo*. Though you may learn a few words here and there, Duolingo's *Greek course* consists mostly of English cognates and provides grammatically incorrect/very "off" sounding sentences. Though it may be useful to learn vocabulary in conjunction with other tools, you shouldn't rely on it to learn the grammar of the language. If you wish to learn Greek grammar and useful vocabulary, check out [**Language Transfer**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeA5t3dWTWvtWkl4oOV8J9SMB7L9N9Ogt), instead.
#### Conjugation Tools
Websites whose sole purpose is providing declension tables tend to inadvertently provide incorrect conjugations or provide forms that simply don't exist in Modern Greek (they tend to be automatically generated and don't accept corrections). If you wish to learn verb conjugation, [greekgrammar.eu](https://www.greekgrammar.eu) provides resources for all the important Greek grammar rules.
#### Ancient Greek Resources
This one may sound obvious, but searching "Greek" into Google will provide many more Ancient Greek resources than Modern Greek, and it may be difficult to tell the difference as a beginner. To be sure you aren't learning Ancient Greek, simply include Modern Greek in your search, or double check with someone who knows Greek.
#### AI Tools
Unless, when you're reading this, AI has taken over the world, avoid using large language models such as ChatGPT for Greek. Tools such as these don't completely understand the grammar of Modern Greek and fail to produce natural sounding speech, and in many instances, makes mistakes that may hinder your progress. Unless you're using an AI powered translation tool, such as [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator), you should avoid using AI all together.
#### Setting your expectations too high
Many influencers online may try to convince you that you can learn a language in 1 month, 2 weeks, or however short of a time as possible. If it sounds ridiculous, it probably is, and odds are they are trying to sell you something. **You cannot learn Greek in a month.** You may think you can, but you can't. Setting your expectations too high or comparing yourself to those who's job it is to learn languages will either result in you losing your motivation or beating yourself up when you aren't at the state you expected.

### Alphabet & Pronunciation
Since the Greek Alphabet is completely unique, you're going to have to learn all these new letters and how they're pronounced in order to read and write in Greek. There may also be new sounds not in your native language that you'll have to learn (such as γ and χ for native English speakers).
#### IPA & Modern Greek Phonology
For those who know the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), the Modern Greek phonology [can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology). If not, each letter and letter combination along with hidden pronunciation rules are listed below. There also exists a [document by Greek Discord server owner, Poursa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EM3m7nNcakFX0p3y5mn9_I2M9c18iJhbaGKyIAIz3tk/edit#heading=h.da5yucucm0iz) to aid in learning the alphabet.
#### The Alphabet
Below you will find a list detailing the Modern Greek Alphabet and the sounds they produce. Specific letter combinations may produce different sounds (yes, Greek has diphthongs). If you don't want to read the list below, see [this video by GreekPod101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyHQ5rSkdsg&t=158s&pp=ygUUZ3JlZWtwb2QxMDEgYWxwaGFiZXQ%3D).
#### Sounds found in English
Alpha (Αα) 
- In English, our "a" sound is more open than the one in Greek. This "a" sound is closer to the "u" in "nut". [An example pronunciation can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-open_central_vowel).
Beta (Ββ) 
- Pronounced like “v”, as in “**v**ery”.
Delta (Δδ)
- Pronounced like “th”, as in “**th**e”.
Epsilon (Εε)
- Pronounced like “e”, as in “b**e**t”.
Zeta (Ζζ)
- Pronounced like “z”, as in “zoo”. In English, our "z" sound is a little bit different (this applies to "s") as well. [An explanation for this can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArvaniti200712-7:~:text=/s/%20and%20/z/%20are%20somewhat%20retracted%20(%5Bs%CC%A0%2C%20z%CC%A0%5D)%3B%20they%20are%20produced%20in%20between%20English%20alveolars%20/s%2C%20z/%20and%20postalveolars%20/%CA%83%2C%20%CA%92/.%20/s/%20is%20variably%20fronted%20or%20further%20retracted%20depending%20on%20environment%2C%20and%2C%20in%20some%20cases%2C%20it%20may%20be%20better%20described%20as%20an%20advanced%20postalveolar%20(%5B%CA%83%CB%96%5D).%5B7%5D).

- Pronounced like “th”, as in “**th**anks”.
Kappa (Κκ)
- Pronounced like “k”, as in “**k**ey”.
Lamda (Λλ)
- Pronounced like “l”, as in “**l**ove”. In English, our "l" sound is a little bit different (depending on region). Greek utilizes a "light" l, where as ours is a "dark" l. [An explanation for this can be found here](https://sandiegovoiceandaccent.com/american-english-consonants/how-to-pronounce-the-l-sound-light-l-vs-dark-l).
Mu (Μμ)
- Pronounced like “m”, as in “mu**m**”
Nu (Νν)
- Pronounced like “n”, as in “**n**ag”
Xi (Ξξ)

Pi (Ππ)
- Pronounced like “p”, as in “**p**ot”.
Sigma (Σσς)
- Pronounced like “s”, as in “**s**ock”. The previous note about our "z" and "s" sound being different [applies here, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArvaniti200712-7:~:text=/s/%20and%20/z/%20are%20somewhat%20retracted%20(%5Bs%CC%A0%2C%20z%CC%A0%5D)%3B%20they%20are%20produced%20in%20between%20English%20alveolars%20/s%2C%20z/%20and%20postalveolars%20/%CA%83%2C%20%CA%92/.%20/s/%20is%20variably%20fronted%20or%20further%20retracted%20depending%20on%20environment%2C%20and%2C%20in%20some%20cases%2C%20it%20may%20be%20better%20described%20as%20an%20advanced%20postalveolar%20(%5B%CA%83%CB%96%5D).%5B7%5D).
Tau (Ττ)
- Pronounced like “t”, as in “**t**ie”.
Phi (Φφ)
- Pronounced like “f”, as in “**f**ur”
Psi (Ψψ)
- Pronounced like “ps”, as in “si**ps**”. The previous note about our "z" and "s" sound being different [applies here, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArvaniti200712-7:~:text=/s/%20and%20/z/%20are%20somewhat%20retracted%20(%5Bs%CC%A0%2C%20z%CC%A0%5D)%3B%20they%20are%20produced%20in%20between%20English%20alveolars%20/s%2C%20z/%20and%20postalveolars%20/%CA%83%2C%20%CA%92/.%20/s/%20is%20variably%20fronted%20or%20further%20retracted%20depending%20on%20environment%2C%20and%2C%20in%20some%20cases%2C%20it%20may%20be%20better%20described%20as%20an%20advanced%20postalveolar%20(%5B%CA%83%CB%96%5D).%5B7%5D).

As noted above, Σ, σ, ς and Ζ, ζ are pronounced slightly differently to the English S and Z. Don’t worry about learning this different pronunciation as a beginner if it's to difficult, as most Greek people aren’t going to hear the difference. It should also be noted that these sounds **are not the same** as the English “sh” or the “zh” sounds found in words such as “**sh**ip” and “mea**s**ure”. It may sound that way to you, but they are not. Pronouncing these letters this way is much worse than simply pronouncing them as their English equivalents.

**Groups of letters may produce different sounds than what is expected from each individual sound. Here’s a list of them here:**
ΜΠ/μπ
- Pronounced like “b” as in “bo**b**”. May also be pronounced like “mb” if not found on the first syllable of a word, such as in “e**mb**assy”.
ΝΤ/ντ
- Pronounced like “d” as in “dad”. May also be pronounced like “nd” if not found on the first syllable of a word, such as in “dandy” ([example pronuncation here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArvaniti200712-7:~:text=Voiced%20stops%20are,%CE%BD%CF%84%20in%20Greek.)).
ΟΙ/οι/ΕΙ/ει/ΥΙ/υι
- Pronounced like “ee”, same as with η/ι/υ.
ΑΙ/αι
- Pronounced like “e”, same as with ε.
ΑΥ/αυ/ΕΥ/ευ
- If preceding a non voiced sound, this is pronounced like “af” or “ef”.  [Example for αυ, here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%84%CF%8C/), and [example for ευ, here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82/). If preceding a voiced sound, this is pronounced like “av” or “ev”. [Example for αυ, here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF/) , and [example for ευ, here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1/). An explanation as to what "voiced" and "unvoiced" means [can be found here](https://i.imgur.com/9V11SDK.png).
ΓΓ/γγ/ΓΚ/γκ
- Pronounced like “g” as in “**g**uard”, though may also be pronounced similar to “ng” ([example pronunciation here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC/)) if not found in the first syllable of a word, such as “mango” ([explained here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArvaniti200712-7:~:text=Voiced%20stops%20are,%CE%BD%CF%84%20in%20Greek.)).
ΤΖ/τζ
- Pronounced like a “dz” sound, such as in “pi**zz**a” ([example here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_affricate)). Example pronunciation [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%84%CE%B6%CE%AC%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%B1/).
#### Sounds not found in English
Rho (Ρρ)
- Pronounced as the single tapped "r", as found in languages such as Spanish. Example pronunciation [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%80%CF%8C/). May be pronounced as a slight trill when found after a consonant.
Chi (Χχ)
- When χ precedes any ε or η/ι/υ sound, it’s most similar to the English “h” as in “hello”. However, it’s not the same, and is pronounced slightly harsher (imagine a cat hissing). Example pronunciations [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%87%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B9/) (χε), [and here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%87%CE%B9%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B9/) (χι).
- When χ precedes any o/ω, α or ου sound, it is pronounced a bit differently. There’s no good English representation for this, but is represented with “jo/ja/ju” in Spanish. Example pronunciations [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%87%CF%8E%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82/) (χω/ο), [here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC/) (χα) [and here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%86%CF%84%CE%B1/) (χου). This also applies to any χ that doesn’t precede a vowel ([such as in προχθές](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%B8%CE%AD%CF%82/)).
Gamma (Γγ)
- When γ precedes any ε or η/ι/υ sound, it’s most similar to the English “y” as in “yellow”. Similarly to χ, it’s not the same and is pronounced a little harsher. Example pronunciations [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1/) (γι), [and here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B3%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B1/) (γε).
- When γ precedes any ο/ω, α or ου sound, it is pronounced like a half “g”. It is sometimes represented as “gh”. Again, there’s no good English representation for this, but can be practised by repeatedly producing the “g” sound without the stop at the end. Example pronunciations [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B3%CE%B1%CE%BC%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%82/) (γα), [here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B3%CE%BF%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1/el/) (γο) [and here](https://forvo.com/word/%CF%84%CE%BF_%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BD%CE%B9/#el) (γου).
Γχ/γχ
- Here, the χ is pronounced as expected, where as the γ changes to be more similar to “n” in “bang” ([explained here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology#:~:text=The%20alveolar%20nasal,stress%27)). Example pronunciations [can be found here](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%B3%CF%87%CF%8D%CE%B6%CF%89/) (γχυ), [and here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%AC%CE%B3%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%82/) (γχο).

If you are still struggling with gamma (Γγ) and chi (Χχ), you may find [this video from Easy Greek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwe8dNI0WcU) useful. Though it's in Greek, it also has English subtitles.
#### Pronunciation Tips
Stress marks in Greek denote which syllable is stressed on a word, for example - the word [άλλα](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B1/) differs from [αλλά](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC/). This also occurs in English, but we just don't write it. For example with ***con***flict (the noun), and con***flict*** (the verb).

There is also the double dotted stress, such as with "ϊ" and can be combined with the regular stress mark to form "ΐ" (meaning that syllable takes the stress). This mark is used to separate two vowel sounds, such as in [κοροϊδεύω](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%8A%CE%B4%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89/) and [ιδιοφυΐα](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%86%CF%85%CE%90%CE%B1/).

Vowels are [not reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction) in Modern Greek (such as with English and Russian). For example, the word “America” in English is often pronounced “uh-me-ruh-cuh” where almost if not all the vowels turn into an “uh” sound. This does not occur in Modern Greek. For example with the word [αμερική](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE/), where all vowels are clearly pronounced. (a-me-ree-kee).

Hard consonants are not aspirated. In English, for example, consonants such as “t”, “k” and “p” are pronounced as “tuh”, “kuh” and “puh” with breath (aspiration) behind it. This does not occur in Modern Greek. Because of this, these sounds may sound similar to “d”, “g” and “b” to a beginner (though they are not).

With the letters “κ” and "γκ", if a front vowel is found after, this sound also moves further forward. For example, the word "και" may sound more similar to “kye” than “ke”. Example pronunciations for this [can be found here](https://forvo.com/word/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9/#el), and [here](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%9A%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CF%8C%CF%82/).

Words such as δεν, μην, τον, etc. result in the “Νν” sound being assimilated if followed by a voiceless stop. For example, τον πατέρα is pronounced [το μπατέρα](https://forvo.com/word/%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD_%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B1/#el) (*to batera*), τον τόνο is pronounced το ντόνο (*to dono*) and την καρδιά is pronounced [τη γκαρδιά](https://forvo.com/word/%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89_%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BD_%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%BF_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC./#el) (*tee garthia*).

Sigma (Σσς) becomes voiced (Ζζ) when found next to a voiced consonant, for example with [συμπέρασμα](https://forvo.com/search/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1/), [σβήστρα](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%A3%CE%B2%CE%AE%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1/). This does not apply to vowels ([αγοράζω](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B6%CF%89/) and [αγοράσω](https://forvo.com/search/%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%89/) are two different words).

There’s a rule regarding unstressed Ιι (iota) before any other vowel and how it changes. An explanation for this [can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/H7m7E7s).

Greek vowel elision rules (e.g. I am -> I’m in English) [can be found here](https://greekgrammar.eu/pdffiles/vowel%20elision.pdf).
### Grammar and Phrases
Once you have learned the alphabet and can read Greek, the time has come to learn the grammar along with some useful words. This section will detail many beginner and intermediate friendly resources to help teach the grammar of the language.
#### Language Transfer
This is my personal all-time favourite course for learning Modern Greek. It's a podcast series (120 episodes) that goes through all the basic Modern Greek grammar while teaching you useful vocabulary in a natural, easy to remember way. It can be found [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHsgJkV9J30&list=PLeA5t3dWTWvtWkl4oOV8J9SMB7L9N9Ogt), and [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/languagetransfer/sets/complete-greek-more-audios), along with [a transcript, here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c69bfa4f4e531370e74fa44/t/5d03d32873f6f10001a364b5/1560531782855/COMPLETE+GREEK+-+Transcripts_LT.pdf).

It may also be a good idea to pair Language Transfer with another source to learn vocabulary (as the course is mainly grammar focused). Tips for improving vocabulary [can be found here].
#### κλικ στα ελληνικά
κλικ στα ελληνικά is a book series providing lessons for students of levels from A1 - C1.  These books are entirely in Greek, however, so it may be a bit difficult to use as a complete beginner (and you may need someone to help you). Links to each level can be found below.
- [Levels A1 through to B2 can be found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QvhYqj3ionZB3wDX_zzsoYMXqqbDHqHD).
- [Level C1 can be found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k85X_RVaD6WTwJFAGOM8JwiQoGmk2Xij?usp=drive_link).
#### Greek Lessons Online
Greek Lessons Online is a YouTube channel providing useful vocabulary and grammar rules for beginner learners. Their videos encompass all the grammar you'll need up until a B1 level, [and can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/@greeklessonsonlinevideos).
#### GreekPod101
GreekPod101 teaches a lot of "tourist Greek", in a sense, but is still a source of useful resources. They have videos detailing useful phrases and words along with tutorials to learn the alphabet, [and can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/@GreekPod101).
#### Do You Speak Greek?
This video makes videos mostly in Greek (with both English and Greek subtitles), while speaking slower than normal to improve comprehension. They have videos teaching grammar and phrases for beginner to intermediate levels, [and can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/@DoYouSpeakGreek).
#### Linguatree
Linguatree's videos are mainly focused at complete beginners, as she speaks Greek very slowly in her videos (with subtitles in various languages), while teaching useful grammar and vocab.
